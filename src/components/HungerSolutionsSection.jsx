       " Hunger is a widespread and complex problem that affects millions of
        people worldwide, particularly children. It can lead to malnutrition,
        poor health, and cognitive issues, and is exacerbated by poverty,
        environmental factors, and political instability. COVID-19 has worsened
        the situation. Addressing hunger requires policies to reduce poverty,
        improve education and healthcare, and enhance food systems, as well as
        political will and global cooperation. "
